AutoStarX Version 1.1

AutoStarX allows you to upgrade the flashrom of your Autostar on Mac OS X
(497,495 only for now).
You need a usb to serial adapter (keyspan, ftdi,...) and of course a Meade 505
serial cable (or a home made one). 

The upgrade should take about 23 minutes (tested on a dual G4 1.25GHz MDD and
a PowerBook G4 1GHz).

If there is an error during the upgrade you will need to restart your autostar
in "Safe Load" mode (press enter and the down key close to the "?" while 
powering the autostar) and redo the upgrade (same procedure as with the ASU
from Meade).

Make sure you have a stable and good power supply while upgrading the autostar.

Plan for future versions :
- Support of Autostar II
- Support for Dick Seymour patches
