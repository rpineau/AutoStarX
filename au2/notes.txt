Things to do:

Short Term
	- If in safe mode on AS2, remind user that baud rate is set to 9600
	- Improve Help Text
	- Seymour Request:  allow drag-and-drop for text files of custom user objects
	- Change "Yes"-"No" in AutoConnect to "OK"-"Cancel"
	- Make it so that message windows are children, i.e., not always TOPMOST
	- Report tour downloading bytes in real time
	- Add baud rate to status bar
	- When garbage collection fails, provide a failure status message
	- Instead of the system generated "Handle is Invalid", how about a more user friendly "Could not open Serial Port"?
	- Bug: Had version 10F of firmware, started upgrading to 1.2a
		after 1% complete, error dialog "No Response" popped up, status stayed frozen at %complete,
		and controls stayed disabled
	D Prompt user to backup User data before upgrade (Seymour email 8/21)

	*** END 3.61 REVISIONS ***
	D Look at why initialize handbox after upgrade often fails (AS2)
	D Investigate 494 being destroyed by ASU
	D add flag to Tours so you know its extended when retrieving
	X Save on exit doesnt always work (test installation of WWW setup.exe)
		= reinstall web file, then run either installation
	D Seymore Comments to 3.60 beta
		D spell out comma, colon, etc. in define custom dialog
		D change Editter to Editor
		D Change references to Radio Button to Object Type Button
		D make custom object select dialog modeless, or make it easier to escape
		D editting screen only accepts 10 characters????
		D Radio buttons broken on library side??? - no, just Seymoured - made a small change
		D dismiss "to add new custom catalog..." status message
		D refer to LX200 cable by its part number
	D allow slower (9600) baud rate in DOWNLOAD mode
	D Fix Verify Download mode
	D Disable Drag & Drop in Real Time Mode
	D Restart Hbx Menu Item should be on BEFORE connection
	D Import remembers last object, but doesn't show files (e.g., *.txt )
	D Import doesn't force you to specify type like it once did
	D Enable regular (class 19) user objects
	D Fix Bug: if downloading handbox code, and advanced options clicked, program crashes & says "invalid handle"
	D Fix bug:  after upgrading AS II, available memory function fails immediately, but
				after a brief wait, it works OK
	D Fix bug:	memory leaks if editing item label in listview
	D Fix bug: cannot import a large number of objects at the same time
	D if handbox in safe-mode, do not request avail memory
	D do not allow object data to be up/downloaded in safe mode
	D if in safe-load mode, dont send restart command
	D display current COM port
	D During erasing old objects, provide some status percents
	D Fix Bug: available handbox memory calculates: 
			remaining memory - size of collection
		It should calculate:
			total memory - size of collection
	D During a send operation:
		= after deletecatalog() and forcegarbagecollection(), make sure that
			the available memory > size of collection being sent
	D Fix Bug: during erase of 240K or 300K of objects, operation dies and responds
		"check autostar connection" after about 60-120 seconds.
		Repeated erases of the data will eventually clear everything out
	D Fix Bug: cannot upgrade when in safe mode - is this really a bug? or is my handbox fucked?
			No, it's really a bug
	D disable sorting columns in real time mode
	D verify that free memory is being reported acurately
	D deactivate realtime button during upgrade handbox & safe mode
	D Color Background of Dialog, for those poor Win95 users who can't use custom images
	D Disable Transfer Controls during send
	D Fix bug: safe mode exits after upgrade, even when upgrade fails
	D After upgrading hbx, update ver info (in Release mode)
		= God damn it!  It only works if you InitializeConnection() after upgrading,
			but then the handbox is left in download mode.
		= added boolean parameter to skip GetVersion(), which forces download mode
	D Fix Bug: tried sending 270k of data.  It got to deleting tours, spent a long time doing the operation,
		then just as it moved to the next catalog, it returned with "power cycle autostar" and displayed
		a status of Out Of Memory, handbox was dead - could not be connected
		restarting worked.  On subsequent try, it finished OK.
		I then upped the timeout to 10 minutes, and restarted the operation completely,
		and it worked, but took 17 minutes to erase the 5 catalogs
		= talk to Hoot
	D Fix Bug: on Send command, if handbox cannot be found, it tries to send anyway
	D LX200: make garbage collection smarter
	D create special case of upgrading from ver. 1.0b to anything else:
		= retreive objects from handbox
		= erase banks 30 - 37
		= send user objects back
	D Eliminate Restart Button, restart automatically
	D update help text
	D update release notes
	D OnConnect button should restart handbox

	D Gray out download from web & garbage collect & load & save to hbx 
		during handbox transactions
	D Make Send All to Library function the same way as Send All to Handbox
	D On Upgrade Hbx Dlg, sort revs from highest to lowest
	X Add decimal point to version from web, i.e. "1.1A" not "11A" in UpgradeDlg
		= not necessary, adding decimals to version in header works just fine
	D Fix Bug: entering new user object, with a magnitude of -x, it appears in
		listview as +-x
	D Incorporate new tour format

Medium Term
	- Add counts of objects imported
	- Figure out why CImage class does not work in Win95
	- Rewrite ErrorLogDlg so that it does not use a dialog resource, i.e. use a dlg template 
		( this will make it truly portable)
	- Fix bug: if performing a long operation (such as erasing old objects), then tool tips
		are presented in status bar, status returns to "ready", not last status
	D Add ability to change User Sites & Name

			D when entering field names in define dlg, "enter" should add name
			D Disable for 497
			D Handle Real-Time Mode
				D if in RT Mode, and delete all objects, catalog must all be deleted
				D Plug Big Time leaks!
			D Transfer Actions
				D Single Transfer from one list to another
					= check if source and dest catalogs have same CatalogName and Size. If so,
						- transfer objects
						If not,
						- if dest is default catalog, create the catalog
						- else warn that data may be lost in transfer
				D Transfer All Objects from One list to the other
				D Transfer All User Objects from one list to the other
					D if handbox is a 497, ONLY transfer UserObj
					D if no handbox or ASII, iterate through all UserObjXX classes
						- delete the destination catalog
						- copy the source catalog to the destination
			D What to do about different catalog definitions in the handbox and library collections?
				= perhaps warn that some data may be lost, and make sure all fields are within size limits
				= transfer all must delete all first

			D when New file selected, reset the custom user obj radio button headings
			D when a file is loaded, reset the custom user obj radio button headings

	D Remember last selected object type in import dialog box
	X for LX-200 SetBaud command, if in download mode, check that baud rate is going to 56k
	D Edited item changes don't always show up. When other item hilighted then update shows up
	D Create Force Garbage Collection in Options Menu

Long Term
	- Redo the methods of enabling/disabling buttons, something like:
		- have several member variable such as
			= m_currentProcess {DOWNLOADING, TRANSFERING, IDLE...}
			= m_hbxSafeMode TRUE or FALSE
			= m_ASType {TYPE_AUTOSTAR, TYPE_AUTOSTARII}
		- then in the onpaint method, call the same function, which
			evaluates the state of these 3 variables, and turns buttons
			on or off as appropriate
	- allow user to rearrange object order
		= by drag and drop
		= by up/down arrow keys
	- allow user to reorder columns
	- save column order/width settings to registry
	- add thread to seek handbox connection repeatedly
	- copy and paste web data
	- make graphical buttons
