 How to get to SAFE LOADER MODE IN YOUR Autostar

If the firmware in your Autostar crashes and you
cannot access the "DOWNLOAD" menu item on your
handbox, you can use the "SAFE LOADER" feature of
your new Autostar software (version release 1.1g
and above of Autostar, and all versions of Autostar
II).

Note:
 To get into SAFE LOAD, follow these simple steps:

 1. Make sure the Autostar and Telescope are turned off.
 
 ********************************************************
 For an Autostar Handbox: (ETX, #495, #497, etc.)

 2. Press and hold the "ENTER" key and the Scroll
    Down Key located to the right of the help key
    on the Autostar handbox.
    
 3. While depressing both keys, turn on your Telescope
    power switch.

    You will need both hands to accomplish this.

	You should see "FLASH LOAD READY" on your display.
	You may see a version number following the
	"FLASH LOAD".  In this case the display would read
	"FLASH LOAD 2.0 READY".  Either of these display
	formats indicates that you can proceed to Update
	your Autostar with new software.

 ********************************************************
 For an Autostar II Handbox: (LX-200 GPS)
	
 2. Turn on your telescope power switch.
 
 3. IMMEDIATELY type 999 on the keypad of the handbox.  The
    handbox LCD should display "Downloading...DO NOT POWER
    OFF".  It it does not display this, repeat the procedure.
    If it still does not display this message, there may be
    a more serious problem and you should contact Meade
    customer service.

 ********************************************************
 5. Start the ASU program.
	At this point you can retrieve the body data from
	the autostar by pressing the Retrieve button on the
	dialog. If the data is not corrupted it will appear
	in the handbox list window.

 6. Press the "Update Autostar Software Now" button.
